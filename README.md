I'm trying to speak english... but... as you can see... ðŸ’€
## languages i use
I'm Very good at C99-C11, OK at C++, insanely good at Lua, very bad at python, can write SQL for sqlite3 with manuals in chrome tab. Could write javascript, but don't really want to.
## my recommendations on libraries
[here](recommend.md)
## tools i use(d)
- Debugging
  - x86dbg. Don't ask. 
  - GDB. I can sit and think in it for a while, read help and do simple things, but nothing more. I can't live in debugger without GUI, i'm lost person ðŸ’€
- Asan, leak sanitizer, leakcheck, cppcheck, `-fanalyze`... 
- Gnu Make. Not bad.
- CMake. I have bad relationships with it at this moment, but it should be good.... Hopefully...
- Cygwin. Wine.
- c/c++ compilers GCC, CLANG, MINGW.
