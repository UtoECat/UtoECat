## Tools i use
- Debugging
  - x86dbg. The best you can find for windows i guess.
  - GDB. ~~I can sit and think in it for a while, read help and do simple things, but nothing more. I can't live in debugger without GUI, i'm lost person ðŸ’€~~
    UPD: i kinda like GDB CLI more than UI now. GUI may be useful for visualisations, but CLI is the most reliable interface. it would be great if there were more tutorials for it when needed it most.
    If you are still using GUI debuggers - you should at least try using GDB from CLI for a week. It's really good.
- Asan, leak sanitizer, leakcheck, cppcheck, `-fanalyze`... 
  - I wish there were UB checking out of the box in GCC/Clang, but...
- Gnu Make. Not bad.
- CMake. I have bad relationships with it at this moment, but it should be good.... Hopefully...
  UPD: It's not really...
  I changed my mind a lot about build systems really. When i worked at companies, it was usual thing to have overcomplicated and overbloated build process, which noone trully understands.
  But with time i start appreciate minimalistic build systems more. To level of simple bash/python scripts, or Make. 
  Although i understand that the point of CMake is to provide crossplatrofm way to build stuff... I wish Make became more adopted in windows instead, because Cmake is insane sometimes.
- Cygwin. Wine.
  - Cygwin is the most reliable way to get uniform expirience between windows/linux without perfomance loss of wsl s far.
  + your binaries are portable as hell, if build correctly. I built luajit/other specific sofytware dll's multiple times on it, and it works great.
- c/c++ compilers GCC, CLANG, MINGW.
- VIM. :e review.txt\nihello, this is my vim review\ni love it.ESCyy333p:wq. 
- VSCode, NVim.
  YES, I PUT THEM TOGETHER< FIGHT ME!!1
  the poblem with nvim, is that it essentially became vscode 2.0, but without enough level of quality. yep.
  i think you can configure nvim better for yourself, but it takes much more time than even configuring vim.
